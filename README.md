### What I learned
In CSS, I learned about the efficiency of 'display: none;' to toggle between the two photos. Initially I took on controlling a media query via JS, but it became more problematic than it should be. 'display: none;' is something I have not needed in a project until now.

I had previous used classList.toggle for other projects, however managing this entirely in CSS became a more elegant solution.
